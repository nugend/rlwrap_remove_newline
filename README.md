# Remove Newlines
A rlwrap filter to remove newlines from multiline input created while using rlwrap's editor mode (Ctrl-^)

This rlwrap filter is useful for interpreted languages which cannot accept multi-line input in their prompt, but support multi-line statements/expressions. It strips newlines and attempts to remove leading whitespace.

No guarantees!
